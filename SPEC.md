# Shared SolidTV viewing client

Implements viptv-org/design#4 and TV_IMPLEMENTATION.md at DESIGN_REF. One SolidTV application owns remote focus, the 700ms hold, screens and user actions across browser TVs and Roku. Browsers use the v2 WebGL renderer when available and lazily load the existing Canvas renderer otherwise. Roku uses native SceneGraph primitives. The backend remains authoritative for profiles, queue/history, source ranking and media preparation.

Acceptance separates browser automation, actual media and physical-device evidence. The shared remote layout fits the available viewport without requesting fullscreen at startup. Playback uses the pinned video adapters and real media; direct/copy/remux remain preferred where supported. Signing, firmware, controller input and performance limits are recorded in TESTING.md.

Implementation checkpoint: IMPLEMENTATION.md. Spec issue: https://github.com/viptv-org/tv-web/issues/1. Execution/acceptance issue: https://github.com/viptv-org/tv-web/issues/2.

## Hosted entry

`/tv/`, `solid.html` and the legacy `lightning.html` alias start the same SolidTV application. Hosting packages contain the emitted TV import graph. The account/admin surface remains separately owned; publishing the TV bundle does not replace it. Native desktop hosts retain their own fullscreen, transport and decoder acceptance requirements.
