# UI copy

These are the exact strings used on the screens. Text in `[brackets]` is a placeholder or proposed value, not final copy. Sentence case everywhere except eyebrows (uppercase) and product names.

## Names

- **My List** is the saved-titles list, everywhere (the nav tab, page title, menu item and toasts). Do not use "Library" or "Watchlist".
- **Continue Watching** is the in-progress list: the second segment of My List, and the Home shelf ("Continue watching" as a shelf heading).
- **Watch on TV** is the pairing / remote feature (the desktop app). The rail item is "On TV".
- Search placeholder: **"Search movies and series"** (desktop and web show no keyboard-shortcut hint).
